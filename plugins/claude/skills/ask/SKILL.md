---

You are running RingFrame Ask inside Claude Code. The person supplies and
approves the intent; the host owns task execution. Requires the `ringframe` CLI
on PATH. Native confirmation and delivery follow the profile in section 1.

The exact source intent is:

<source-intent>
$ARGUMENTS
</source-intent>

Use `Write` for staging; it creates the staging directory itself.

## Ask boundaries

- Before confirmation, use tools only to read the profile and directives, stage
  and compile the candidate, read its rendered prompt, and show native
  confirmation. Do not inspect project files, research, or begin the work.
- Preserve the source intent exactly. Never invent project technology,
  architecture, business context, policy, acceptance criteria, or permissions.
- For Ask preparation and ledger commands, run exactly one plain `ringframe …`
  command per shell call: no `&&`, `;`, pipes, `cd`, `mkdir`, `which`,
  `command -v`, or host version probes. Use the host's file-writing tool to stage
  inputs. Confirmed task execution follows the selected profile and normal
  host permissions.
- If `ringframe` is not found, stop and tell the person to run
  `uv tool install ringframe`; never write ledger records by hand.
- Never print classification labels, `NEXT_COMMAND`, or compiler protocol.
  Show the stored prompt through confirmation and delivery as described below.
  Never claim activation or submission without the corresponding evidence.

## 1. Read the profile and route

Run `ringframe profile show --host claude-code --json`. This is the routing
authority: read `routing.guidance`, `routing.precedence`, and each capability's
`selection`, `effects`, `confirmation`, `activation`, `delivery_mode`,
`continuation`, and `limitations`. Do not read research files or maintain a
separate list of capabilities in the skill.

Classify the source intent's task, desired result, interaction, horizon, and
effects. Compare the returned capabilities using their selection guidance and
precedence; the user does not need to know or name a native command. Select
only an ID returned by this profile. Preserve explicit constraints and explain
material uncertainty in the route gaps rather than inventing requirements.
If the selected capability has `requires_explicit_request_for_effects`, set
`explicit_direct_request` to true only when the source itself requests immediate
execution or skipping planning; otherwise choose a fitting alternative.

Use the selected capability's `confirmation.tool`. Check it is available before
compiling. Missing or rejected native confirmation stops this Ask without
confirming or continuing; do not substitute ordinary chat or change host settings.

If concerns are relevant, run `ringframe deltas list --host claude-code --json`
and use its merged `concerns` vocabulary to classify them. Otherwise omit
concerns. The CLI reads the global and project delta files; project values win.

Use these JSON shapes for `--classification` and `--route`. Replace example
values and angle-bracket placeholders with this intent's classification and
route explanation; lists stay lists and strings stay strings.

```json
{"task": ["implement"], "result": "workspace_change", "interaction": "approval_gated", "horizon": "session", "effects": ["write"]}
```

`task` items come from `question research clarify plan implement diagnose review
operate document`; `result` is one of `answer plan workspace_change evidence
continuing_objective`; `interaction` is `interactive` or `approval_gated`;
`horizon` is `one_turn`, `session`, or `persistent`; `effects` items come from
`read write execute external_effect`. Optional `concerns` is a list of names
from the merged vocabulary above; omit it when none applies.

```json
{"fits": "<why this capability fits>", "alternatives": [{"capability": "<alternative profile capability ID>", "reason": "<why it fits less well>"}], "continuation": "<what happens after confirmation>", "effects": "<effects in words>", "gaps": [], "explicit_direct_request": false}
```

Use an empty `alternatives` list if no alternative applies. Do not guess a host
version or session ID: the CLI resolves them from the plugin hook's capture.

## 2. Compose and persist before asking

1. Run `ringframe deltas render --host claude-code --capability <id>
   --classification '<json>' --json` with the classification above. The CLI
   selects the directives that apply to this Ask (`host.entries`,
   `practice.entries`); you never choose, drop, or add rules.
2. Write the prompt in two parts. First, one concise, optimized task brief
   preserving the source intent's artifacts, paths, and constraints. Keep the
   original wording only in `source.txt`; do not prepend or quote it before
   the optimized brief. Then a line `Rules:` followed by one line per supplied
   directive you apply:
   `- <label>: <that directive applied to this task's specifics>`, using the
   `label` values the CLI returned (several labels may share one line when
   one sentence applies them together). Every label must come from the
   supplied set; the CLI refuses unknown labels and records which supplied
   directives you applied or omitted. Do not restate a directive generically
   or explain a principle. Do not add a command prefix: the CLI adds it.
3. Under the project workspace root (the current working directory), never
   under this skill's directory, write `.fab7/rf/tmp/stage-<nonce>/source.txt`
   with the exact source intent and `.fab7/rf/tmp/stage-<nonce>/composed.txt`
   with only the composed prompt. Persist the candidate before showing the
   chooser so its record exists even if the turn ends early.
4. Only after both files exist, run
   `ringframe ask compile --staged <dir> --title "<short title>"
   --capability <id> --classification '<json>' --route '<json>' --host
   '{"name":"claude-code","surface":"native-tui"}' --json`.
   Keep the returned `ask_id`. On a reported input-validation error, correct
   that input without changing the source intent and retry. If the same error
   recurs, the cause is unclear, or the failure is not input validation, show
   the error and stop. Never confirm a failed compile.

## 3. Confirm with the native tool

Run `ringframe ask copy --ask <ask_id>` to obtain the complete rendered prompt
verbatim; never retype or summarise it. Call the selected capability's
confirmation tool with one single-select question. Explain the selected
capability, why it fits, why the alternatives fit less well, and the expected
continuation and effects. Offer `Proceed (Recommended)`, the most relevant
alternative returned by the profile if one applies, and `Cancel`.

For `AskUserQuestion`, use header `Ask route`, put the complete rendered
prompt in the Proceed option's `preview`, and set metadata source to
`ringframe.ask`. Say the person may type a revision or select another route.

A different route or free-text revision means stage and compile a new candidate
with `--link revises:<previous ask_id>`, then ask again. Every candidate shown
is persisted; only the last one is confirmed.

## 4. Record the answer and deliver

- Proceed: run `ringframe ask confirm --ask <ask_id> --json`. Deliver only
  after that command succeeds.
- Cancel: run `ringframe ask cancel --ask <ask_id> --reason "<why>" --json`
  and stop.
- No answer (dismissed, timed out, or empty): run
  `ringframe ask cancel --ask <ask_id> --reason "chooser dismissed" --json`
  and stop. Report cancellation only if the command succeeds. Never interpret
  a missing answer as approval.

After successful confirmation, use the selected capability's delivery fields:

- `human_handoff`: run `ringframe ask delivery --ask <ask_id> --handoff`
  and show its output verbatim. The person submits the stored prompt.
- `native_dispatch` with an `activation.tool`: call that tool, then follow
  the profile's continuation with the confirmed prompt as the brief. Claim
  activation only from its result and the profile's receipt mechanism; never
  invent a receipt. If activation fails, record
  `ringframe ask delivery --ask <ask_id> --state delivery_failed --reason "<error>"`,
  then run `ringframe ask delivery --ask <ask_id> --handoff` and show its output
  verbatim. Stop if recording the failure fails.
- `native_dispatch` without an activation tool: continue in this turn using
  the confirmed prompt under normal host permissions. Record nothing else.

Submission is `observed` only when the prompt hook matches the compiled input.
`ringframe ask submitted --ask <ask_id>` records the person's attestation as
`attributed`; use it only when the person actually attests submission. A handoff
alone does not establish submission.
